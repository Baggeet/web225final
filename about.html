        Reading Area Community College was founded on October 1, 1971, and sponsored for 20 years by the
        Reading School District. Classes were held for the first time on October 13, 1971, with an enrollment
        of 265 students. The college operated from several buildings throughout Reading during its early years
        until it acquired the Holiday Inn (the current Berks Hall building) in 1978. On July 1, 1991,
        the Berks County Board of Commissioners assumed sponsorship of the college. In 1996, the college completed
        a campus expansion plan that transformed it into an attractive city-based campus.</p>
